Dependencies:
python 3
numpy

To run the code, type the following into your command line:

`python econophysics [r] [sigma] [T] [S] [X] [N] [n]*`

Replace the arguments in brackets with numbers of your choice. Try this:

`python econophysics 0.1 0.5 100 15 16 1000 30`

These happen to be the default arguments as well. If you only wanted to include the first k arguments, then you need only supply the first k arguments, and the code will use the defaults listed above.
